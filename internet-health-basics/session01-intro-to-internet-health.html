            <h1>Preparation</h1>

            <p>Review the entire lesson and try each activity so you know how it works.</p>
            
            <p>Visit Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/Internet-health/">Internet health site</a> and <a href="https://Internethealthreport.org/v01/">Internet health Report</a> to learn more about issues related to Internet health.</p>
          </li><!-- End of step -->

          <li>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <div class="time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Begin by welcoming your learners and introducing the idea of Internet health by saying something like this:</p>
            
            <blockquote>A healthy Internet needs all of us. The Internet is our largest shared global resource. The healthier it is, the more it benefits everyone. We can all be a part of keeping the Internet open, safe and accessible.</blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>A healthy Internet help people live and learn online. It includes everyone in its possibilities. It belongs to the people and resists being closed off or broken apart. On a healthy Internet, we are all free to share and benefit from one another innovative, new ideas because of a culture of inclusivity, openness, and care.</blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Some big ideas connected to Internet health include:</blockquote>
              
              <ul class="fancy">
                <li><strong><em>Web Literacy</strong></em> - Everyone should have the skills to read, write and participate in the digital world.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Digital Inclusion</strong></em> - The quality of the Internet is a reflection of the diversity of the people who are able to access and contribute to it. </li>
                <li><strong><em>Privacy and Security</strong></em> - Privacy doesn’t mean you have something to hide. It means you have the ability to choose who knows where you go and what you do.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Decentralization</strong></em> - When just a few organizations and governments control the majority of online content and access, the vital flow of ideas and knowledge is blocked.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Open Innovation</strong></em> - Everyone deserves the ability to create and compete online without paying for permission.</li>
              </ul>

            
            <blockquote>Internet health depends on us to adopt habits that promote shared values like these. It doesn’t happen by itself.</blockquote>
            
            <p>After introducing Internet health, invite for 3-5 volunteers to share their responses to questions like these before going on in the lesson:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Which of those ideas seem most important to you? Which ones interest you the most?</li>
              <li>Do you have any ideas or questions about how those ideas might connect to Internet health in our community or in your own life?</li>
              <li>What do you think might happen if we let the Internet become too unhealthy?</li>
            </ul>
</p>

          </li> <!-- End of step -->

          <li>
            <h1>Offline Activity</h1>
            <div class="time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>In this step, you and your learners will compare and contrast health and unhealthy online behavior on popular sites or apps.</p>
            
            <p>The big idea is to help learners see the kinds of choices they have about their online behavior.</p>
            
            <p>You can ask for suggestions from your learners, but make sure that the apps and sites you use are appropriate, inclusive, and positive for your community.</p>
            
            <p>Begin by saying something like:</p>
            
            <blockquote>To keep learning about Internet health, we’re going to think about healthy and unhealthy behavior on some of our favorite apps or sites. Unhealthy online behavior is sometimes also called “toxic” behavior because it poisons communities. Let’s think about healthy and unhealthy behavior on a site like [use a popular app or site or a learner’s suggestion here, such as FaceBook].</blockqoute>
              
              <p>As you invite responses from your learners, chart their answers somewhere easily accessible and readable in your learning space. You can use a simple chart like this:</p>
              
              <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/Internet-health-chart-1.png" alt="A chart with two columns comparing and contrasting how healthy and unhealthy behaviors look online and how the benefit and disadvantage us, respectively"></p>
              
              <p>Make sure you document and share the ideas you come up with together.</p>
              
              <p>Repeat the process with new charts for 1 or 2 more apps or sites before moving on to the next step.</p>

          </li><!-- End of step -->
          
          <li>
            
            <h1>Reflection &amp; Assessment</h1>
            <div class="time">5 minutes</div>
            
            <p>Facilitate a brief reflective discussion on what your learners discovered about Internet health. You can record learners’ responses for the purposes of assessment, but be sure to do so in an equitable way that doesn’t disadvantage one learner or another because of your choice of medium.  You might use prompts like these or create your own:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>What surprised you today?</li>
              <li>In your own words, how would you explain Internet health?</li>
              <li>What are some healthy habits we should try to form online?</li>
              <li>What are some unhealthy habits we all should avoid online?</li>
              <li>Which of the Internet health issues interests you the most? Why?</li>
              <li>What is something you could do right now that would help improve Internet health?</lki>
              </ul>
